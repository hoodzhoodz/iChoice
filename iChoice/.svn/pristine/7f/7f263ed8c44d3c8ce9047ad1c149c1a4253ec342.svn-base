            <li>
                For the people with normal blood pressure?Twice a week
                and had better choose the fixed time between 6am~9am.
            </li>
            <li>For people with abnormal blood pressure Suggest twice a day and continuous for one
                week. The measurement was conducted between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., and again between 6
                p.m. and 9 p.m.

    <h2 class="askRow">Why do I get different readings with my blood pressure monitor than those at
        the doctor’s?</h2>
    <div class="answerRow">
        Blood pressure readings in hospital are usually somewhat
        higher than the blood pressure. readings you obtain when you
        measure it yourself in a relaxed atmosphere at home. We call
        this "doctor's surgery" or "white coat" hypertension. People who
        have raised blood pressure under the stress of everyday conditions
        can have normal readings under quiet conditions at the
        doctor's. We then speak of "doctor's surgery normotension"
    </div>

    <h2 class="askRow">Why are different readings obtained in 2 successive readings?</h2>
    <div class="answerRow">
        <div>
            Blood pressure and pulse depend on many factors that can
            have an effect even in the shortterm:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Physical influences</li>
            <li>Medical influences</li>
            <li>Physical exercise</li>
            <li>Muscle tension</li>
            <li>Talking</li>
            <li>Excitement</li>
            <li>Noise etc</li>
        </ul>
        <div>The way the measurement is taken is also relevant:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Cuff applied too tightly / too loosely</li>
            <li>Cuff not at heart level</li>
            <li>Too short a break between measurements</li>
            <li>No visual or acoustic shielding of the subject</li>
            <li>
                Device tolerances are also important, of course. In the case
                of devices with a manometer, there is also parallax error
                (error in reading the result).
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <h2 class="askRow">
        Why are there differences between measurements on the upper
        arm and the wrist?
    </h2>
    <div class="answerRow">
        The wrist measurement must be taken with the wrist at heart
        level. If the arm is laid flat on a table, for instance when you are
        seated, the blood pressure is overestimated by approximately
        7-8 mmHg because there is a difference from heart level (1.5cm
        is equivalent to 1 mmHg).<br/>
        Incorrect results also occur with wrist measurement in the case
        of heart rate abnormalities and changes (e.g. due to age) in the
        arteries of the wrist. Particularly in elderly persons,
        wrist devices may give imprecise readings. The arteries in the
        upper arm are not so sensitive with regard to these influences.
        For this reason, occasional measurements on the upper arm
        are recommended for comparison.
    </div>

    <h2 class="askRow">What are the guidelines for systolic and diastolic pressure?</h2>
    <div class="answerRow">
        The normal range of systolic blood pressure is 90 ~ 140mmHg,
        diastolic blood pressure is 60 ~ 90mmHg.
    </div>

    <h2 class="askRow">
        Is an upper arm blood pressure monitor more accurate than a
        wrist type?
    </h2>
    <div class="answerRow">
        The choice of device is basically one of convenience. Some
        people find the compactness of a wrist blood pressure monitora
        benefit especially if one is travelling. Others prefer the larger
        buttons and display on the upper arm blood pressure monitors
        (easier to use and read).
